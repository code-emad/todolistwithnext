# Todo List Application created with Next.js

This project was generated with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) version 13.4.8.

## Purpose
I wanted to to learn more about Next.js and what better way than to create an application. The goal of this project was for me to gain familiarity with Next.js. By working on this application, I was also able to gain a better understanding of Tailwind CSS and the Prisma library.

## Functionality
The user can see a list of all tasks and can click on each task on the list to strike them out. If a user clicks on 'new', they will have the ability to create a new task that will be added to the list. The user has the option to delete a task from the list with the delete button.
